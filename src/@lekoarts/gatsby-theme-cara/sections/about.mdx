## About

> Sr. Software Engineer at ASOS.com | .NET | MS Azure | AWS | DevOps | Angular | React | Flutter

I have written code that does solve problems of a few people and some features for a retailer 
having 14 million customers. I’ve been making some good and some great projects for over a decade. 
From my experience I have learned many lessons due to my constant urge to experiment.
I code, play video games and some sport, learn and listen – usually not in that order.
